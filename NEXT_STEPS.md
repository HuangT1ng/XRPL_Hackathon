- IPFS node connection for milestone photos
- Xero/PayNow API integration for credit scoring
- Email/SMS notifications

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Test the Application** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Visit these URLs in your browser:
http://localhost:5173/          # Landing page
http://localhost:5173/test      # XRPL integration test
http://localhost:5173/onboard   # Campaign creation
http://localhost:5173/portfolio # Portfolio management
```

### 2. **Connect Real XRPL Wallet** (15 minutes)
- Test wallet connection on the landing page
- Try the XRPL integration tests at `/test`
- Verify mock data is loading correctly

### 3. **Test Campaign Creation Flow** (10 minutes)
- Go to `/onboard` and walk through the 5-step wizard
